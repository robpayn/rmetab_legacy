<h1>Eco-Agent <b><tt>resource.water</tt></b> Definition Package</h1>

<body bgcolor="white">
<h2>Overview</h2/>

<p>The water package defines fluxing and storing for all water connections in all types of compartments.  Currently, the compartment types include <tt>surface</tt> (channel) and <tt>ground</tt> water.  The next compartment type to be added will be <tt>atmosphere</tt>.</p>

<p>Originally, the ground water storage compartment was called simply "ground" but as the heat package was added, it became necessary to separate the ground compartments into the water-holding portion and non-water-holding portions, or pore-space and sediment, respectively.  The pore-space portion is now called <tt>gndwater</tt> while the non-pore-space portion is called <tt>sediment</tt>.</p>
